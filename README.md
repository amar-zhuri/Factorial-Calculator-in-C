# Factorial Calculator in C

This C program calculates the factorial of a given non-negative integer. It prompts the user to input an integer and then computes its factorial recursively.

## Usage
1. Compile the program using a C compiler (e.g., GCC):
gcc factorial_calculator.c -o factorial_calculator
2. Run the compiled executable:
./factorial_calculator
3. Enter the non-negative integer for which factorial is to be calculated.

## Example
$ ./factorial_calculator
5
120

## Note
- The program uses recursion to compute the factorial of the input integer.
- Factorial of 0 and 1 is defined as 1.
